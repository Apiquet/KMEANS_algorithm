# KMEANS algorithm

K-means algorithm classes n observations into k 
clusters in which each observation belongs to the nearest cluster. 

I applied this algorithm to compress and reconstruct an image.

You can either run ''test_image_compression.m'' or go to the ''Results'' folder to see the results
